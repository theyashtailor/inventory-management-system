**Title: Inventory management system**

Scenario: An online manufacturing business finds it challenging to effectively track and manage its large inventory. The company sells a variety of products under various brand names, and managing inventories manually has grown labour-intensive, prone to mistakes, and detrimental to the general efficiency of the organization.

Business Challenge: The current manual inventory management system is leading to inaccuracies, stockouts, overstock situations, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. This results in lost sales opportunities, increased carrying costs, inconsistent production and a poor customer experience due to delayed or unavailable products. 

The company needs a solution that provides real-time visibility into its inventory, automates key processes, and streamlines the overall supply chain with proper reports.

Four primary user types are included in inventory management systems.
Users:

1.	Administrators: The employees or division in charge of overseeing all business operations are known as administrators. Majorly they enter and maintain products and brands in the database. This user type has complete access to the database through the website's backend portal.

2.	Customer: Consumers are another important source of data for the database system since they build and update their profiles and use the website to make purchases.

3.	Inventory management staff: This user type oversees the company's supply chain and is in charge of tasks including order processing and inventory control. This kind of user has restricted access to the database; while they can add or edit specific tables, they are unable to remove anything from the database.

4.	Customer care representative: This user type is in charge of helping customers by responding to their inquiries on the company's behalf. They have access to a restricted database, such as just a customer table.
